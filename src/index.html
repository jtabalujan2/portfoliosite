        <h3>
          I'm a front-end developer that is located in Northridge, CA. I am passionate about bringing a great user
          focused experienced with the code that I write.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          My hobbies include basketball, gaming and a hot bowl of pho. My journey so far has included working and
          traveling with a Division 1 NCAA basketball team, worked for an NBA team, and being a free lance graphic
          designer at the age of 14. I've recently realized my passion for development and am ready to contribute my
          skills and passions to an organization. If you'd like to learn more or listen to my story, let's get in touch.
